# Employee System

#Overview
The application is made up of two types of users: the administrator and the employee. These users interact with the system differently depending with their roles.

#Users of the System
#Employees.
The application enables employees to be able to manage their requests for leaves by specifying the start and end date of the leave. The application has a restriction of up to thirty days hence an employee cannot take a leave that exceeds this limit.
The employees can plan accordingly based on their leave status on whether it has been approved or declined.
The employees further receive notifications concerning the approval or decline of their leaves hence enabling them to stay updated without manual follow up.

#Administrator
The administrator is in charge of everything. Their key functionalities entail adding the details of an employee, checking if the added details have been uploaded, editing the details of the employees, and deleting the details of those employees who are no longer in the company.
